{"sentence": "\"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "its really cool .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"second , the \"\" automatic \"\" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "it also lets you remove songs from the play order .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie .\"", "label": "1"}
