{"sentence": "\"all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "this is really a nice diaper pail .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find ! .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ! .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! . )\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "so for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models i 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i like that .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "in my table the m12v has been a real champ .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp+ router workhorses .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "wish i could give it 4 1/2 stars .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $25 incentive ( you need the code -- -go to tool seeker . com and it tells you )", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $135 ! .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "saw the hitachi on amazon . com with their $25 . 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "both the on/off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "what an upgrade ! . ! . ! .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i have only used it with the 1/4 \"\" collet and a 1/2 \"\" round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo's .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i prefer things that are simple .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "i love the performance and features of this router .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it 's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "smooth plunging mechanism .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i purchased two of these beauties .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy/junk ) routers i have previously purchased .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i would however highly recommend the m12v router ! .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "i use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "you just can 't go wrong with this one ! .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "enjoy .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this is an excellent router for the price .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "the m12v has been great .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the height adjustment works well- not perfect .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "i did like the heft of the machine .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic's and sennheisers .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the menus are easy to scroll through ; . they are laid out naturally , and make sense .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the computer interface is 90% good , only losing points due to the fact that \"\" creative \"\" branding is all over the place within it .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the \"\" add to cart \"\" button already ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the fit and finish of the product is first-rate .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"overall , i am very pleased with it .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the player is smaller than you think .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the zen micro is near perfect .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack . . . char ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the accessories that come with the player are great .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "best in class .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "pick your favorite color and buy it .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs . com for more on that ) .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $15 dollars i think ) .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable ! .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "+battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"+sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $14 . 95 flat fee .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the sound is very nice .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"its also smaller , and gets more looks .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this is really a no brain er .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player ; . equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "sound quality ? . phenomenal .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "tough as nails .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "flawless .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": ") no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "gets nice sound too .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"in conclusion , this player is beautiful .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"power for the tech-savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "but it ; . you won 't regret it .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the extra gb is just a bonus .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the zen offered a great alternative .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly categorized into the zen .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"oh , and another is the cool \"\" halo \"\" light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"one : it 's size : it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"otherwise , this is a great \"\" alternative \"\" mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer ' .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .\"", "label": "1"}

{"sentence": "\"the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .\"", "label": "1"}
{"sentence": "\"i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .\"", "label": "1"}
